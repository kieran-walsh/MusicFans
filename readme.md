### The code
- Implemented the site using HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript, PHP, and SQL
- Wrote 17 files from scratch and over 2000+ lines of code
- Created a database of 5 tables to store users, posts, bookmarks, vector matrices, and recommendations

#### NOTE: Per the instructions of the professor, security/authentication were not the focus of this project. Instead, the project was more of a full-stack exploration of design patterns, analytics, and personalization features.
